        ## Summary
        Brief explanation of the feature/change.

        ## Motivation

        ### Problem Statement
        What problem are we solving? What use cases does this support?

        ### Current State
        What is the current approach and why is it insufficient?

        ### Success Criteria
        How will we know this proposal is successful?

        ## Detailed Design

        This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
        familiar with the project to understand and implement.

        ### Architecture Overview
        High-level design and components.

        ### Implementation Details
        Specific implementation approaches and considerations.

        ### API/Interface Changes
        Any changes to existing APIs or new interfaces.

        ## Drawbacks
        Why should we *not* do this? What are the costs?

        ## Rationale and Alternatives

        ### Why This Design
        - Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
        - What are the key benefits of this approach?

        ### Alternatives Considered
        - What other designs have been considered?
        - What is the rationale for not choosing them?

        ### Impact of Not Doing This
        What happens if we don't implement this proposal?

        ## Implementation Plan

        ### Phase 1: Foundation
        - [ ] Task 1
        - [ ] Task 2

        ### Phase 2: Core Features
        - [ ] Task 3
        - [ ] Task 4

        ### Phase 3: Polish & Documentation
        - [ ] Task 5
        - [ ] Task 6

        ## Unresolved Questions

        - What parts of the design need to be resolved during RFC review?
        - What parts can be resolved during implementation?
        - What related issues are out of scope but could be addressed later?
