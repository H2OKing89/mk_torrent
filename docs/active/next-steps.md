## üìà **Medium-Term Goals (Next Month)**

### **Phase 5 Completion: Full RED Integration**

- [ ] **Comprehensive testing** with RED sandbox environment
- [ ] **Error handling** for all edge cases and API failures
- [ ] **Performance optimization** for large audiobook uploads
- [ ] **User documentation** and setup guides
- [ ] **Release v1.0** with full RED integration

### **Quality & Polish**

- [ ] **Increase test coverage** to 80%+ across all modules
- [ ] **Add integration tests** for complete workflows
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking** and optimization
- [ ] **Security audit** of credential handling and API usage

### **User Experience**

- [ ] **Setup wizard improvements** for RED configuration

## üöÄ **Getting Started Today**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Review RED API documentation** in `docs/reference/RED_API_REFERENCE.md`
2. **Set up RED sandbox account** for testing (if available)
3. **Begin implementing RED API client** in `src/mk_torrent/api/red_integration.py`
4. **Test current upload queue infrastructure** with mock uploads

### **Development Flow:**

```bash
# Start working on RED integration
git checkout feature/red-tracker-integration
cd /mnt/cache/scripts/mk_torrent

# Run tests to ensure foundation is solid
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Start development server/environment
python scripts/run_new.py --help

# Begin implementing RED API integration
# (Edit src/mk_torrent/api/red_integration.py)
```
