# TL;DR

- Successfully modularized metadata core engine into focused components
- Improved test coverage and maintainability
- Enhanced integration test suite for audiobook workflows

# Context

Working on refactor/metadata-core-modularization branch to break down monolithic metadata processing into smaller, focused modules. Current focus on audiobook complete workflow testing and validation.

# Findings / Decisions

- Separated metadata validation from core engine logic
- Created dedicated audiobook processing pipeline
- Established integration test patterns for complex workflows
- Maintained backwards compatibility with existing interfaces

# Next Steps

- [ ] Complete integration test coverage for all audiobook scenarios
- [ ] Review and merge modularization changes
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Performance testing on refactored components

# Artifacts

- Code: `tests/integration/test_audiobook_complete.py`
- Branch: `refactor/metadata-core-modularization`
- Related: Metadata engine refactoring in `src/` directory
