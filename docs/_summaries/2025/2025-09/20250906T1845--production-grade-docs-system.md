summary: Implemented a comprehensive documentation management system with automation, quality gates, and lifecycle management.

# TL;DR

- Built a production-grade documentation system with automation and quality gates
- Implemented 7 core scripts for docs lifecycle management
- Enhanced VS Code integration with tasks, snippets, and keybindings
- Added comprehensive quality gates and dashboard-style documentation index

# Context

Enhanced the existing documentation structure to eliminate "mystery meat docs" and provide a scalable, automated system for managing technical documentation across the mk_torrent project. Built on the foundation of the initial_summaries organization.

# Findings / Decisions

- **Naming Convention**: Adopted kebab-case with ISO-8601 timestamp prefixes for chronological sorting
- **Front-matter Standards**: Implemented consistent YAML front-matter with status, tags, and metadata
- **Automation First**: All repetitive tasks automated with Python scripts and VS Code integration
- **Quality Gates**: markdownlint, cspell, and pre-commit hooks prevent documentation drift
- **Lifecycle Management**: Active docs auto-archive when stale, keeping the workspace focused

# Implementation Artifacts

## Core Scripts (`scripts/`)

- **`gen_docs_index.py`** - Enhanced dashboard generator with recent changes, status breakdown, and tag clustering
- **`rename_docs.py`** - Bulk normalize filenames to kebab-case with date extraction
- **`fix_timestamp_T.py`** - Fix timestamp casing (uppercase T for visual clarity)
- **`update_doc_timestamps.py`** - Auto-update front-matter timestamps on save
- **`auto_archive_active.py`** - Lifecycle management for active/ folder
- **`new_adr.py`** - Create Architecture Decision Records with auto-numbering
- **`new_rfc.py`** - Create Request for Comments with structured templates

## VS Code Integration (`.vscode/`)

- **Tasks**: 12 automated tasks with inputs for ADR/RFC creation
- **Snippets**: Enhanced templates for docs, ADRs, RFCs, and front-matter
- **Keybindings**: Quick access to dashboard generation and document creation
- **Extensions**: Recommended markdown tooling and spell checking

## Quality Gates

- **markdownlint** - Consistent formatting and structure
- **cspell** - Project-specific dictionary and spell checking
- **pre-commit hooks** - Auto-run quality checks and index generation
- **Link checking** configuration for external URL validation

## Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── _summaries/YYYY/YYYY-MM/    # Timestamped Copilot sessions
├── active/                     # Current work (auto-archived when stale)
├── adr/                        # Architecture Decision Records

```

# Next Steps

- [ ] Add front-matter to existing core documentation files
- [ ] Set up CI workflow for automated quality checks on PRs
- [ ] Consider MkDocs Material for public documentation site
- [ ] Add link checking to pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create directory README files as navigation signposts

# Key Features Implemented

## ✅ **Automation**

- One-command dashboard generation with rich statistics

- ADR/RFC creation with auto-numbering

## ✅ **Quality Assurance**

- Consistent file naming conventions
- Comprehensive spell checking with project dictionary
- Markdown linting with project-specific rules
- Pre-commit hooks for automatic quality enforcement

## ✅ **Lifecycle Management**

- Active docs auto-archive when stale
- Status-based organization (draft/active/approved/deprecated)
- Tag-based clustering for topic discovery
- Recent changes tracking and visualization

## ✅ **Developer Experience**

- VS Code tasks with keyboard shortcuts
- Rich snippets for all document types
- Input prompts for interactive document creation

# Artifacts

- Scripts: `scripts/*.py` (7 automation scripts)
- VS Code: `.vscode/{tasks,snippets,keybindings,extensions}.json`
- Config: `.markdownlint.json`, `cspell.json`, `.mlc.json`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Generated: `docs/readme.md` (enhanced dashboard)
- Examples: `docs/adr/adr-0002-*.md` (auto-created ADR)
